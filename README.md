# Osmosis Swaprouter Worskhop

This is a workshop for building an Osmosis Swap Router CosmWasm contract.

The original contract repository is located here:

## What Is This

A contract that allows to swap an **exact** amount of tokens for a **minimum** of another token, similar to swapping a token on the trade screen GUI. While anyone can trade, only the contract owner can pre-define a swap route. Most importantly, traders are able to specify the **maximum price impact percentage** to avoid having large trades resulting in significant price fluctuations.

## Why Do We Need This

This contract can be used by other client contracts such as:

- Dollar-cost-average (DCA)
- Portfolio balancing
- Simulating limit orders
- Trading strategies
- Lending protocols

and many many others.

## Workshop Goals

- Understanding CosmWasm Fundamentals.
- Getting familiar with reply messages.
- Utilizing [osmosis-rust](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-rust)
    * [osmosis-std](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-rust/tree/main/packages/osmosis-std)
    * [osmosis-testing](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-rust/tree/main/packages/osmosis-std)
- Interacting with the Osmosis chain in CosmWasm.
- Learning more about swaps and TWAP.

## CosmWasm Fundamentals

- [CosmWasm Zero-To-Hero by @Callum-A](https://github.com/Callum-A/cosmwasm-zero-to-hero)
- [CosmWasm Semantics](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/SEMANTICS.md)

## Checkpoints

We will over the development of the contract from scratch. The following checkpoints (git branches)
are available to jump to any specific point in the workshop.

- [0. Setup and Contract Boilerplate](https://github.com/p0mvn/swaprouter-workshop/tree/checkpoint/0-setup-boilerplate)
- [1. Complete Instantiate Message and Write Out Stubs](https://github.com/p0mvn/swaprouter-workshop/tree/checkpoint/1-instantiate-msg-stubs)
- [2. Implement Set Route Message](https://github.com/p0mvn/swaprouter-workshop/tree/checkpoint/2-set-route-msg)
- [3. Implement Queries](https://github.com/p0mvn/swaprouter-workshop/tree/checkpoint/3-queries)
- [4. Implement Basic Swap Message](https://github.com/p0mvn/swaprouter-workshop/tree/checkpoint/4-swap-msg)
- [5. Final Result: Swap with Maximum Price Impact Percentage](https://github.com/p0mvn/swaprouter-workshop)
